  <h1 align="center">Greetings, I'm Ricardo Medeiros</h1>
  <p align="center">
    I'm a Biomedical Engineer and a software developer. I'm currently studying at 42 Lisboa.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
    I'm a curious person, and my journey into Sciences and Software Development began with a deep 
    passion for math, logical thinking and science (which I've learnt how the things work).
  
    The curiosity naturally led me to pursue my goals, where I always strengthened my analytical mindset. 
    Over time, my interest in programming grew even stronger, and I began to dive deeper into software 
    development when I discovered 42 Lisboa. There, I’ve been building a solid and growing foundation in 
    software engineering project-based learning.
    
    I work mainly with low-level programming, UNIX systems, and C/C++, while also gaining experience with 
    higher-level languages and full stack development. 
    Learning by doing, collaborating with peers, and constantly challenging myself have become central to 
    my growth as a developer.
    
    I’m deeply motivated to keep learning new concepts and programming paradigms, and I enjoy immersing myself 
    in challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone.
    
    Outside of coding, I enjoy watching anime, reading manga, and following football,
    always supporting my childhood and lifelong club, SL Benfica. Music is another
    constant presence in my life, with Queen being my favorite band. These interests fuel
    my creativity, curiosity, and persistence — qualities that strongly shape the way I
    approach engineering and problem-solving.
