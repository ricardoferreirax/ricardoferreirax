## 🧠 About Me

Greetings! I’m Ricardo, a biomedical engineer on a journey toward becoming
a software developer. I have a growing foundation in low-level programming and UNIX
systems, along with experience in some high-level languages.

I hold a degree in Biomedical Engineering, but I began to dive much deeper into
programming when I discovered 42 Lisboa.

At 42 Lisboa, I found an environment that challenged me to think critically and truly
learn by doing. The school’s project-based approach pushed me to work autonomously,
while also learning a great deal from my peers and friends. Through this experience,
I’ve built a solid foundation in software engineering, working mainly with C/C++,
Bash, and process management, while also exploring higher-level development and
full stack technologies.

I continue to learn every day, constantly refining my skills and expanding into new
areas of software development. I’m highly motivated to keep learning new concepts,
technologies, and programming paradigms, and I enjoy immersing myself in challenges
that push me beyond my comfort zone and help me grow both professionally and
personally.

Outside of coding, I find inspiration in music — especially Queen and The Beatles —
and enjoy spending time with animals, mostly cats (I have three, by the way).
Curiosity, persistence, and love for learning guide both my personal and
professional journey.
