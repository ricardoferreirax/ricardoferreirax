<!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <h2 align="center">🧠 About Me</h2>

  <p>
    My journey into science and software development began with a deep passion for
    numbers, mathematics, and logical thinking. Curiosity has always driven me to
    understand how things work — not just on the surface, but underneath.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mindset led me to pursue Biomedical Engineering, strengthening my analytical
    approach to problem-solving. Over time, my interest in programming grew stronger,
    and discovering <strong>42 Lisboa</strong> marked a turning point in my path.
  </p>

  <p>
    At 42 Lisboa, I’ve been building a solid and growing foundation in software
    engineering through project-based learning. I work mainly with low-level
    programming, UNIX systems, and C/C++, while also gaining experience with higher-
    level languages and full stack development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning by doing, collaborating with peers, and constantly challenging myself
    have become central to my growth as a developer. I’m deeply motivated to keep
    learning new concepts and programming paradigms, always seeking challenges that
    push me beyond my comfort zone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coding, I enjoy watching anime, reading manga, and following football,
    always supporting my childhood and lifelong club, <strong>SL Benfica</strong>.
    Music is another constant presence in my life, with <strong>Queen</strong> being my
    favorite band. These interests fuel my creativity, curiosity, and persistence —
    qualities that shape the way I approach engineering and problem-solving.
